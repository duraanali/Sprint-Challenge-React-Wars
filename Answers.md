1. What does it mean to think in react?

1. Describe state.

Answer: State means the part of the component that can change. The state of the component is the part that changes with user input, any changes in the database or any change in the UI. 

1. Describe props.

Answer: Props are shortened for Properties and they can be used to pass data from one component to another. They are similar to the way functions use arguements but props connect components to make the application more powerful.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Answer: A "side effect" is anything that affects something outside the scope of the component. These can be a API request, which has your code communicating with a third party. You sync effects by using tools such as Axios to pass data from the API to the component.
